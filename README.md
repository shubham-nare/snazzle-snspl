# 💸 Snazzle – Save Now, Spend Later

Snazzle is a habit-forming personal finance app designed for Gen-Z. It helps users track daily spending, save for long-term goals, and build money discipline — all in a playful, gamified way.

- Encourage **goal-based saving**
- Set **daily spending limits**
- Reward users for healthy financial behavior
- Turn financial discipline into a **daily dopamine hit**
